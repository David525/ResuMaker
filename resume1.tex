		\subsection{Summer Student at The Siroky Group (Toronto, May 2018 - July 2018)}
		\noindent The Siroky Group provides software solutions to the outdoor advertising industry. The software products usually help with things like managing advertisements on billboards and public transit. While employed as a summer student, I did the following:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Wrote a program to collect business data (e.g., name, location, and details of businesses) to use in product demos. My Python program extracted data about thousands of business locations using the Google Maps API, formatted them into demo data and incorporated the data into the software. 
		\item A website was being set up for a prospective client, and content was needed. All of the photosheets of the billboards from the client's existing website needed to be downloaded and identified by the board number and description contained in the photo. My Python program found and downloaded all the photos on the site, used OCR to identify the panel number and description in the photo, then added the data into a database. 
		\item Executed test scripts on web and mobile applications. Reported bugs to developers and identified errors in the test scripts.
		\end{itemize}
		\subsection{Janitor at Eurest Services (Ottawa, July 2017 - April 2018)}
		\noindent Cleaning stands, washrooms and general area and restocking washrooms.
		\subsection{Programming Intern at Mocato (Toronto, May 2016 - August 2016)}
		
		\noindent Wrote an application used for business transaction processing. The application takes information about clients and transactions to generate Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) files. I developed this application (with minimal supervision) using C\# and Microsoft Access.
